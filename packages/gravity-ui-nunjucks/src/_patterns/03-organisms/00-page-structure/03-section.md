## Purpose

The section is just a way to organise a document, it should be used with understanding of its semantic meaning.

For more information read [HTML5 articles and sections: what's the difference?](http://www.brucelawson.co.uk/2010/html5-articles-and-sections-whats-the-difference/).

The pattern currently has the capacity of hosting a title (`<h2>`) followed by any repetition of the following elements:

- paragraph
- blockquote
- unordered list
- list-inline-row
- list-cards-basic
- list-image-links
