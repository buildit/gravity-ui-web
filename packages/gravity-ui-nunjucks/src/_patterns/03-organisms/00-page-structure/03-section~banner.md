## Purpose

The pseudo-pattern ~banner showcases a state in which the section is styled with a colored background that encompasses one end of the viewport to the other i.e. with no margin.

The banner uses the `grav-o-container-banner` class, and should ideally be used to group certain elements that are intended to stand out/be seperate from the rest of the page.
